The semi-adaptive sampling scheme is based on across-shelf transect lines from the coast (20 m bottom depth) to beyond the shelf break. Line-transect surveys are conducted every September since 2013 by a team of 3 experienced observers (2 at a time) while navigating at a constant heading and speed during daytime. Observations are performed with the naked eye, while the identification of species and the number of individuals is aided by 10 × 42 binoculars. For each observation, the radial distance to bird clusters (individual birds or groups of birds of the same species; Ronconi & Burger 2009) and the angle of the cluster sighting with respect to the track-line at first detection are estimated.
